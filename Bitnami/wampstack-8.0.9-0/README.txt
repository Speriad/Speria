		      Bitnami WAMP Stack 8.0.9-0
		    ===========================

1. OVERVIEW

The Bitnami Project was created to help spread the adoption of freely
available, high quality, open source web applications. Bitnami aims to make
it easier than ever to discover, download and install Open Source software 
such as document and content management systems, wikis and blogging 
software.

Bitnami WAMP stack is an easy to install and easy to use open source Web 
Platform. It combines leading open source projects, such as Apache, MariaDB 
and PHP with BitRock's extensive open source expertise to provide a consistent, 
painless way to deploy WAMP in any Linux environment.

You can learn more about Bitnami stacks at https://bitnami.com/stacks/

You can also add applications on top of this stack like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla!,
and more. You can download the Bitnami module for any of these applications
and install on top of your WAMP installation. That way, all of the Bitnami-packaged 
applications you want to run will share a single instance of Apache, MariaDB and PHP 
which will save space and improve performance.

You can learn more about installing modules at
https://docs.bitnami.com/general/infrastructure/wamp/get-started/add-applications-amp/

Bitnami WAMP is also available as a Virtual Machine Image or as a Cloud Image.
Bitnami Virtual Machine Images are pre-configured and include a minimal 
installation of Linux and a Bitnami stack. They are available for VMWare and 
the latest version of VirtualBox. Bitnami Cloud Images allow you to run a 
Bitnami stack in a cloud computing environment on a pay-as-you-go basis. 
Bitnami Cloud Images are currently available for Amazon EC2, with planned 
support for additional cloud environments.

2. FEATURES

- Easy to Install

Bitnami stacks are built with one goal in mind: to make it as easy as
possible to install open source software. Our installers completely automate
the process of installing and configuring all of the software included in
each stack, so you can have everything up and running in just a few clicks.

- Independent

Bitnami stacks are completely self-contained, and therefore do not interfere
with any software already installed on your system. For example, you can
upgrade your system's MariaDB or Apache Tomcat without fear of 'breaking' your
Bitnami stack.

- Integrated

By the time you click the 'finish' button on the installer, the whole stack
will be integrated, configured and ready to go. 

- Relocatable

Bitnami stacks can be installed in any directory. This allows you to have
multiple instances.

4. REQUIREMENTS

To install Bitnami WAMP stack you will need:

    - Intel x86 or compatible processor
    - Minimum of 256 MB RAM
    - Minimum of 150 MB hard drive space
    - A 32-bit or 64-bit Windows operating system such as Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2012
    - TCP/IP protocol support


5. INSTALLATION

The Bitnami WAMP stack is distributed as a binary executable installer.
It can be downloaded from:

https://bitnami.com/stacks/

The downloaded file will be named something similar to:

bitnami-wampstack-8.0.9-0-windows-installer.exe

You can install Bitnami WAMP stack in graphical, text and unattended modes. 
By default the graphical mode will be used.

You will be greeted by the 'Welcome' screen. 

The next step is to select the installation directory. The default installation 
path will be a folder at C:\Bitnami\wampstack-8.0.9-0. If the destination 
directory does not exist, it will be created as part of the installation.

After selecting the installation directory you will be asked for the password 
to the initial MariaDB root and anonymous accounts. This password cannot be empty.

The default listening port for Apache is 80 and for MariaDB is 3306. If those 
ports are already in use by other applications, you will be prompted for 
alternate ports to use.

You are now ready to begin the installation, which will start when you press 
'Next'. 

Once the installation process has been completed, you will see the 'Installation 
Finished' page.

If you receive an error message during installation, please refer to the 
Troubleshooting section.

The rest of this guide assumes that you installed Bitnami WAMP stack in 
C:\Bitnami\wampstack-8.0.9-0 and that you use port 80 for Apache and 3306 for MariaDB.

6. STARTING AND STOPPING BITNAMI WAMP STACK

To enter to your application you can point your browser to
http://127.0.0.1:80/

To start/stop/restart application you can use a graphical management tool
called 'manager-windows.exe'. Double-click on that file or start it.

If you selected an alternate port during installation, for example 18080, the
URL will look like:

http://127.0.0.1:18080/

7. RUNNING COMMANDS IN A CONSOLE

Bitnami console is a script that loads environment variables that need
to be present when using many of the command line tools included in
the stack, such as mariadb, php or openssl.

All of the Native Installers for Bitnami Stacks are completely self-contained 
and run independently of the rest of the software or libraries installed
on your system. For this to work, certain environment variables need
to be configured properly. Before running any stack command line tool, you 
should start the "Bitnami console" to setup the environment. For example
to check the MariaDB or PHP version.

On Windows, you can start the Bitnami console from the Start Menu:

    Start -> Program Files -> Bitnami WAMP Stack -> Use WAMP Stack

    php -v
    mysql -Version


8. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

The installation process will create several subfolders under the main 
installation directory:

   manager-windows.exe: Graphical tool to manage the servers easily
   ctlscript.sh: Script to manage the servers
   uninstall: Uninstaller
   use_wampstack: Script to load the stack environment

   apache2/: Apache Web server.
   php/: PHP Scripting Language.
   mariadb/: MariaDB Database.
   common/: common libraries.
   sqlite/: SQLite database server
   licenses/: Licenses of the components included in WAMP stack.
   frameworks/: PHP frameworks selected during the installation
   docs/: Documents for creating a custom application
   apps/
	phpMyAdmin/: Management tool for MariaDB


9. CREATING AN EXAMPLE

In the doc/ folder you can find two examples to start working with
Bitnami WAMP stack. Take a look at the docs/README.txt file to know
how to create your own PHP application.

# Installer Payload Error

If you get the following error while trying to run the installer from the
command line:
